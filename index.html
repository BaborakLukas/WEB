    <h2>Project 1</h2>
    Exploring Czech Weather Across the Years (1961-2020)

Let me take you back to my first big project! I dived into the world of Czech weather from 1961 to 2020, checking out how temperatures changed over time.

Project Story:

Goal: I wanted to understand the temperature patterns in the Czech Republic.

Data Switch: I got the data from the Czech Hydrometeorological Center. To make it easier to work with, I converted it into JSON. Think of JSON like a cool language that helps organize data neatly.

Learning Fun: Rewriting the data into JSON wasn't just a task; it was like learning a new language. Each step taught me more about how JSON works, and I found it surprisingly enjoyable!

Big Moments:

Data Skills: Turning the original data into a new format was like a puzzle. It wasn't just about coding; it was about understanding the story behind the temperature numbers.

Enjoying the Ride: What started as a coding adventure turned into a fun exploration of weather stories spanning many years.

Tech Stuff:

JSON Skills: I became pretty good at using JSON to handle and organize data.
Results:
At the end of it all, I had a new dataset ready to explore. The journey wasn't just about coding; it was about understanding weather data and getting friendly with JSON.

This project set the stage for more adventures into data and coding. Who knew weather numbers could be so interesting?

    Collaborative Database System Enhancement at AGC Automotive

I am thrilled to share our collaborative efforts in enhancing AGC Automotive's database system alongside my talented friends Jarek Trnka and Miloslav Turyna. Our roles were distinct yet interdependent, combining our skills for a holistic improvement.

API Development (My Contribution):

Role: As the API developer, my primary responsibility was crafting robust APIs to streamline communication within AGC Automotive's database system.

Key Focus Areas:

Efficient Data Transmission: Designed APIs for seamless data retrieval and transmission, optimizing overall system efficiency.
Cross-Functional Collaboration: Worked closely with Jarek Trnka (Frontend) and Miloslav Turyna (Backend) to ensure smooth integration of APIs into the broader system.
Frontend Development (Jarek Trnka):

Role: Jarek Trnka took charge of frontend development, creating the user interface to interact with the enhanced database system.

Key Achievements:

User-Friendly Interface: Designed and implemented an intuitive frontend, ensuring an enhanced user experience.
Seamless Interaction: Collaborated closely with API development to integrate frontend functionalities seamlessly.
Backend Development (Miloslav Turyna):

Role: Miloslav Turyna spearheaded backend development, orchestrating the server-side components of the database system.

Key Contributions:

Data Processing Logic: Implemented robust backend logic for efficient data processing and management.
System Integration: Worked in tandem with API and frontend development teams to create a cohesive and integrated system.
Outcome:
Our collaborative efforts culminated in an improved database system for AGC Automotive. The APIs I developed, the frontend crafted by Jarek Trnka, and the backend orchestrated by Miloslav Turyna seamlessly work together to elevate the overall efficiency and functionality of AGC Automotive's data infrastructure.

This project exemplifies our collective ability to contribute our individual strengths to achieve a common goal. Looking forward to more collaborations and innovative projects ahead!

    <h2>About Me</h2>
 Hey! I'm studying IT at Skolavdf in Varnsdorf. I'm really into databases, especially DBaaS â€“ it's like databases but easier. I know stuff about JSON and a bit of Python, HTML, and CSS.

Outside of tech, I'm all about the outdoors. I love fishing and playing basketball â€“ I'm pretty good at it! But here's the cool part â€“ I'm also into archery and throwing spears. It's like being an ancient warrior but with a twist!

My English is good â€“ like a B2 level. I can talk in English without any problems. I'm also learning a bit of Spanish and German.

Let's hang out and talk tech and cool stuff! ðŸš€
